# Runtime

## 1. Concept
The runtime module in CAMEL allows functions and tools to be executed in 
controlled environments, enabling safe and isolated execution of code.
Modern AI systems, especially those involving autonomous agents, often 
require more than just a simple Python interpreter. They may need to:

- Execute code with security checks to prevent malicious actions.
- Run tasks in isolated environments to manage dependencies or enhance 
security (e.g., using Docker).
- Distribute computational load or access specialized resources by executing 
functions on remote servers.
- Utilize sophisticated configuration management for various components.

The `camel.runtime` module addresses these needs by providing a collection of 
runtime classes and supporting utilities. Each runtime offers a different 
strategy for code or function execution, catering to various use cases within 
the CAMEL ecosystem.

## 2. Types
Runtimes offer flexibility, isolation, and scalability by encapsulating 
various execution contextsâ€”such as local containers, cloud sandboxes, 
remote servers, or guarded environments.
Each runtime implementation provides a standardized interface for adding 
tools, executing commands, and managing the execution lifecycle.
