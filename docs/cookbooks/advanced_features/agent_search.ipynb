            "\n",
            "Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It provides a mathematical framework for understanding the behavior of matter and energy at these small scales, where classical mechanics fails to accurately describe phenomena. Key principles of quantum mechanics include:\n",
            "\n",
            "- **Wave-Particle Duality**: Particles, such as electrons, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.\n",
            "- **Uncertainty Principle**: Formulated by Werner Heisenberg, it states that certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, cannot be simultaneously known to arbitrary precision.\n",
            "- **Superposition**: Particles can exist in multiple states at once until measured.\n",
            "- **Entanglement**: Particles can become correlated in such a way that the state of one particle instantly influences the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Quantum Chemistry**: It helps in understanding chemical bonding and reactions at the molecular level.\n",
            "2. **Semiconductors and Electronics**: Quantum mechanics is essential in the design of semiconductors, which are the foundation of modern electronics.\n",
            "3. **Quantum Computing**: Utilizes quantum bits (qubits) to perform computations much faster than classical computers for certain tasks.\n",
            "4. **Quantum Cryptography**: Provides secure communication methods based on the principles of quantum mechanics.\n",
            "5. **Medical Imaging**: Techniques like MRI rely on quantum mechanics principles to produce detailed images of the human body.\n",
            "6. **Lasers**: The operation of lasers is based on quantum mechanics, particularly the concept of stimulated emission.\n",
