1. Basic Chat:
Response: Sure! Did you know that honey never spoils? Archaeologists have 
found pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old 
and still perfectly edible! Honey's long shelf life is due to its low moisture 
content and acidic pH, which create an inhospitable environment for bacteria 
and microorganisms.

2. With System Message:
Response: Sure! Imagine you have two playful puppies. One is wagging its tail 
on the left, and the other is bouncing around on the right. Now, if you add 
one more puppy who jumps in to join the fun, you'll have a total of three 
puppies! But wait, let's bring in one more adorable puppy who can't resist the 
excitement. 

So now, how many puppies do you have? You started with two, then you added one 
more (three), and added another one‚Äîta-da! That gives you 2 + 2 = 4 happy 
puppies bouncing around! 

That's how math works‚Äîlike a puppy party, where you just keep adding more joy!

3. Streaming Response:
Streaming: Sure! Here we go:

1...  
2...  
3...  
4...  
5...  

Nice and slow! That's counting from 1 to 5!
