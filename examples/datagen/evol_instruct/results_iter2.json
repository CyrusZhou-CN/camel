    "A rectangular garden is to be planted with $m$ rows and $r$ columns of flower beds, where $m$ and $r$ are integers. The total number of flower beds, $N$, satisfies the equation $N = m \\times r + 3$ and $N < 150$. The gardener decides to rearrange the flower beds by adding 2 more beds to each row and reducing the number of rows by 3, still forming a complete rectangle with exactly $N$ flower beds. Subsequently, the gardener attempts another rearrangement by decreasing the number of beds in each row by 1 and increasing the number of rows by 2, and finds that this configuration also results in exactly $N$ flower beds, but with 5 beds left over. What is the largest possible value of $N$?",

    "An investor plans to invest in a bank that offers an annual nominal interest rate of \\(7\\%\\), compounded quarterly. They wish to reach a total of \\(\\$60,000\\) at the end of 5 years. The investor will make an additional deposit at the end of each quarter, which increases by a fixed percentage each quarter. If the total additional deposits over the 5 years should not exceed \\(\\$10,000\\), determine the initial investment amount and the percentage increase per quarter for the additional deposits. Provide your answer in terms of the initial investment amount and the quarterly percentage increase."
