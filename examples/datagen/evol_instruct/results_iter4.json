    "A company plans to invest in a project with an initial investment of \\(P\\) dollars. The project returns compound quarterly at an annual nominal interest rate of \\(6\\%\\). Additionally, the company receives an annual bonus return of \\(2\\%\\) on the initial investment. Each year, the company incurs an annual maintenance cost that grows exponentially at a rate of \\(1.5\\%\\) per year, starting at an initial cost of \\(C\\) dollars in the first year. Furthermore, at the end of each year, the company reinvests \\(5\\%\\) of the compounded returns of that year into the project. After 8 years, the company expects a net profit of \\$100,000 from this investment. However, in the 4th year, the company decides to withdraw an amount equal to \\(10\\%\\) of the total compounded value at the end of the 4th year before reinvesting for that year. Determine the initial investment \\(P\\), given that the initial maintenance cost \\(C\\) is \\$2,000."
