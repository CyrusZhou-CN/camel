    "### The ChatAgent: Your AI Worker\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ChatAgent` is a core component of the CAMEL framework, designed to manage conversations between an AI agent and users. It supports multiple large language models (LLMs), allows for structured outputs, and integrates memory management, tool calling, and response termination features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Flexibility**:\n",
    "   - Supports various LLM backends such as OpenAI.\n",
    "   - Can switch between or combine multiple models using strategies like round-robin.\n",
    "   - Handles both synchronous and asynchronous model calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Memory Management**:\n",
    "   - Maintains conversation history using `AgentMemory`.\n",
    "   - Automatically manages context length based on token limits or message window size.\n",
    "   - Allows saving/loading of memory from JSON files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tool Integration**:\n",
    "   - Supports internal function tools (e.g., calculators, search APIs).\n",
    "   - Allows external tools to be defined, which are not processed by the agent but passed through.\n",
    "   - Records tool call history with inputs, outputs, and metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Structured Output**:\n",
    "   - Accepts Pydantic model classes to enforce structured responses (e.g., JSON format).\n",
    "   - Tries to reformat invalid responses to match the desired schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Termination Control**:\n",
    "   - Integrates `ResponseTerminator` objects to control when the agent should stop responding.\n",
    "   - Supports manual termination via event flags.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Multi-turn Conversations**:\n",
    "   - Manages complex dialogues with multi-step interactions.\n",
    "   - Handles streaming responses from models.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **MCP Protocol Support**:\n",
    "   - Can expose itself as an MCP server to integrate with other systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's ideal for applications such as chatbots, intelligent assistants, and automated agents in research or enterprise environments."

    "### RolePlaying: Collaborative Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "The `RolePlaying` class enables two AI agents to simulate a conversation, where one acts as an assistant and the other as a user. It is commonly used for simulating interactions between humans and AI systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Role Simulation:**  \n",
    "- Simulates conversations between two roles (e.g., \"assistant\" and \"user\").\n",
    "- Each role is managed by a `ChatAgent`, capable of understanding context and generating natural language responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Task Specification & Planning:**  \n",
    "- **Task Specify Agent**: Makes the task prompt more specific or detailed.  \n",
    "- **Task Planner Agent**: Breaks down complex tasks into multiple steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Critic Evaluation (Optional):**  \n",
    "- A `CriticAgent` or human reviewer can be introduced to evaluate the quality of the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Multi-Model Support:**  \n",
    "- Supports various LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o,DeepSeeek).\n",
    "- Allows unified or separate model configurations for each role.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Memory:**  \n",
    "- the memory system is a core module used to store and manage conversation history and context information . It plays a critical role in enabling AI agents to maintain coherence\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Use Case:\n",
    "Imagine you're developing a customer service chatbot. You can use `RolePlaying` to simulate a conversation between a \"customer\" and a \"support agent\" to test how well the bot handles different queries. A critic (either AI or human) can then assess whether the responses are accurate and helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, `RolePlaying` is a powerful  for leveraging AI agents to interact with each other and solve complex problems."

It returns the path to the downloaded file. If the file is\\nsuccessfully downloaded, you can stop the simulation and report the path to\\nthe downloaded file for further processing.\\n5. `scroll_to_bottom()`: Scroll to the bottom of the page.\\n6. `scroll_to_top()`: Scroll to the top of the page.\\n7. `scroll_up()`: Scroll up the page. It is suitable when you want to see the\\nelements above the current viewport.\\n8. `scroll_down()`: Scroll down the page. It is suitable when you want to see\\nthe elements below the current viewport. If the webpage does not change, It\\nmeans that the webpage has scrolled to the bottom.\\n9. `back()`: Navigate back to the previous page. This is useful when you want\\nto go back to the previous page, as current page is not useful.\\n10. `stop()`: Stop the action process, because the task is completed or failed\\n(impossible to find the answer). In this situation, you should provide your\\nanswer in your output.\\n11. `get_url()`: Get the current URL of the current page.\\n12. `find_text_on_page(search_text: str)`: Find the next given text on the\\ncurrent whole page, and scroll the page to the targeted text. It is equivalent\\nto pressing Ctrl + F and searching for the text, and is powerful when you want\\nto fast-check whether the current page contains some specific text.\\n13. `visit_page(url: str)`: Go to the specific url page.\\n14. `click_blank_area()`: Click a blank area of the page to unfocus the\\ncurrent element. It is useful when you have clicked an element but it cannot\\nunfocus itself (e.g. Menu bar) to automatically render the updated webpage.\\n15. `ask_question_about_video(question: str)`: Ask a question about the\\ncurrent webpage which contains video, e.g. youtube websites.\\n\\n\\nHere are the latest 5 trajectory (at most) you have taken:\\n<history>\\n[]\\n</history>\\n\\nYour output should be in json format, including the following fields:\\n- `observation`: The detailed image description about the current viewport. Do\\nnot over-confident about the correctness of the history actions. You should\\nalways check the current viewport to make sure the correctness of the next\\naction.\\n- `reasoning`: The reasoning about the next action you want to take, and the\\npossible obstacles you may encounter, and how to solve them. Do not forget to\\ncheck the history actions to avoid the same mistakes.\\n- `action_code`: The action code you want to take. It is only one step action\\ncode, without any other texts (such as annotation)\\n\\nHere is two example of the output:\\n```json\\n{\\n    \"observation\": [IMAGE_DESCRIPTION],\\n    \"reasoning\": [YOUR_REASONING],\\n    \"action_code\": \"fill_input_id([ID], [TEXT])\"\\n}\\n\\n{\\n    \"observation\":  \"The current page is a CAPTCHA verification page on Amazon.

You can check whether the action step is successful by looking at the\\n`success` of the action step in the history. If successful, it means that the\\npage content is indeed the same after the click. You need to try other methods.\\n- If using one way to solve the problem is not successful, try other ways.\\nMake sure your provided ID is correct!\\n- Some cases are very complex and need to be achieve by an iterative process.\\nYou can use the `back()` function to go back to the previous page to try other\\nmethods.\\n- There are many links on the page, which may be useful for solving the\\nproblem. You can use the `click_id()` function to click on the link to see if\\nit is useful.\\n- Always keep in mind that your action must be based on the ID shown in the\\ncurrent image or viewport, not the ID shown in the history.\\n- Do not use `stop()` lightly. Always remind yourself that the image only\\nshows a part of the full page. If you cannot find the answer, try to use\\nfunctions like `scroll_up()` and `scroll_down()` to check the full content of\\nthe webpage before doing anything else, because the answer or next key step\\nmay be hidden in the content below.\\n- If the webpage needs human verification, you must avoid processing it.\\nPlease use `back()` to go back to the previous page, and try other ways.\\n- If you have tried everything and still cannot resolve the issue, please stop\\nthe simulation, and report issues you have encountered.\\n- Check the history actions carefully, detect whether you have repeatedly made\\nthe same actions or not.\\n- When dealing with wikipedia revision history related tasks, you need to\\nthink about the solution flexibly. First, adjust the browsing history\\ndisplayed on a single page to the maximum, and then make use of the\\nfind_text_on_page function. This is extremely useful which can quickly locate\\nthe text you want to find and skip massive amount of useless information.\\n- Flexibly use interactive elements like slide down selection bar to filter\\nout the information you need. Sometimes they are extremely useful.\\n```\\n        '}, {'type': 'image_url', 'image_url': {'url': 'file:///var/folders/2q/_bzfv_vn0lngh7kmv0q_3rm00000gn/T/image_2074b034ea.png', 'detail': 'auto'}}]}]\n",

    "Through this cookbook, we've demonstrated how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Transform Manual Workflows**: Convert complex, multi-step manual processes into automated agent by using role-playing\n",
    "2. **Integrate Multiple Systems**: Seamlessly connect web browsers, desktop applications, terminals, and file systems\n",
    "3. **some core concepts**: chatagent、roleplaying、workforce、toolkit etc\n",

    "\n",
