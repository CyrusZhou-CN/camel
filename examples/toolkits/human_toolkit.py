Intermediate Information from Agent
Context: To find the derivative of the function f(x) = x^3, we will apply
the power rule of differentiation, which states that if f(x) = x^n, then 
f'(x) = n * x^(n-1). In this case, n = 3.


Intermediate Information from Agent
Context: Using the power rule:
1. Identify n: Here, n = 3.
2. Apply the formula: f'(x) = 3 * x^(3-1).
3. Simplify: f'(x) = 3 * x^2.


Agent Message:
The derivative of x^3 is f'(x) = 3x^2.
The derivative of \( x^3 \) is \( f'(x) = 3x^2 \). 

Heres the breakdown of the steps:

1. **Identify the power**: In this case, the exponent \( n = 3 \).
2. **Apply the power rule**: The power rule states that if \( f(x) = x^n \),
    then the derivative \( f'(x) = n \cdot x^{n-1} \).
3. **Calculate the derivative**: 
   \[
   f'(x) = 3 \cdot x^{3-1} = 3 \cdot x^2
   \]

Thus, the final result is \( f'(x) = 3x^2 \).
